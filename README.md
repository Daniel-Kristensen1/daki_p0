# P0 base solution for AI Engineering
This is the base code for the P0 projekt at AI Engineering, Aalborg University (Design og anvendelse af kunstig intelligens, DAKI).

The purpose of the code is to get you quickly up and running with your P0 project.

## Getting started
1. Clone this repository
2. Install `python` and `opencv`
3. Run `python kingdomino.py`
4. You'll get an "Image not found"-error. Make sure that `image_path` on line 10 points to a valid file from the dataset.
5. When you run again, each tile will be classified as Unknown.
6. It is your job to change the zeros on lines 37-49 to some thresholds that work.
